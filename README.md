## General info
An idea of this app is to group rebars (previously added to the application) by phases and set a distinct colour for each of them. Application window contains a list of phases with a colour marking and checkboxes to enable/disable phase visibility. Other objects are presented in Tekla as grey and semi-transparent. It allows the user to visualize by colour only selected phases. Thanks to that, it is possible to easily analyze the correctness of rebar phases. User can also manage phases of rebars the same as in the Phase Manager.

manage phases of rebars and visualize them in Tekla to easy analyze correctness of data.
